# Regular Expressions

## Defining Regular Expressions

In JavaScript, regular expressions are represented by RegExp objects.
RegExp objects may be created with the `RegExp()` constructor, of course, but they are more often created using a special literal syntax.
Regular expression literals are specified as characters within a pair of slash (/) characters.
